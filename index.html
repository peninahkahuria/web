-Christianity was one of the things introduced by colonies that spread all over Africa and made a great impact in people since most of them transformed to becoming Christians and it became their greatest religion that had the highest number of people. Christianity made a good impact since its teachings were teaching on good morals and good behaviors of Christians.
-Education was never valued in Africa since they believed in children being taught by their elders instead of going to school. The colonies changed that perception by introducing education in Africa which made a huge impact since   Africans started valuing education and reduced illiteracy which enhanced them in getting job opportunities in higher ranks.
-Whenever we have some positive impacts we cant lack some bad impacts too,some western culture were inherited by africans that impacted them in a negative way,some negative ways were like the dressing code,before the colonialists came africans dressed descently but after the colonialist Africans adopted their way of dressing which was out of the African culture.

   Many crimes committed in our societies are majorly committed by youths due to peer pressure and use of their leisure time in bad behaviors. Youths can change that perspective by just involving themselves in much healthy and better activities surrounding them.They can make some group organization and talk to their fellow youths about sex education all about abstaining to reduce the cases of early pregnancies and infection of sexual transmitted diseases. They can also join volunteer work around their areas like distributing food to those less fortunate that can be working with the redcross organization. They can also form groups to nature their talents, this groups can be meeting up on their free time instead of idling around and involving themselves in drug usage and bad companies. By this doings, youths will be more active and less influenced in engaging in immoral activities.</p>

  In our day to day lives we encouter gender inequality  majorly in work places, this is brought about by men taking over the rights of women and taking them as less important in such a way that women have no say in work places,this is seen in "Born a crime" where , young women did not have a list of options when it came to choosing what to do, as apartheid left them two choices; becoming a maid or working at a factory. Patricia Noah, Trevor Noah's mother, found a third option in the sad situation. She took a secretarial course and typing classess   </p>
